# The StrictYAML API Manifesto

We believe:

- APIs should be readable by both humans and machines.
- Efficiency is a feature — smaller payloads mean faster APIs, greener computing, and lower cost.
- YAML, if made strict and safe, can replace JSON in many structured data scenarios.
- Standards should empower — not confuse. No magic booleans, aliases, or unsafe tags.
- Tools should validate, not guess.

StrictYAML is our commitment to a cleaner, safer, more expressive API future.
